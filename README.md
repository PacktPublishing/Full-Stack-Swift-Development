## About the Video Course
Swift is probably the best full-stack language in the world. An essential advantage of Swift as a perfect backend programming language is the safety built into the language. Swift does away with entire classes of errors and crashes. You'll start by installing Xcode to set up your iOS environment and creating your first project. We'll embark further into the exciting world of Swift working with storyboards to build a UI with Auto Layout. You'll get to know about iOS application lifecycle methods and connect your application to the internet using URLSession and parsing JSON. A small section of the course covers building models and downloading images. Delving deeper into the course, you'll add authentication and learn to manage your current users by building sign-up and logging forms, handling JWT tokens, and using current user data. You'll integrate your core data into your application and explore its relationship with core data. You'll set up your project using CocoaPods and implement features using third-party frameworks. Finally you'll write tests using XCTests, and test/mock your API calls. By the end of this course you'll be able to build a reliable UI for your application and integrate it with the frontend.
